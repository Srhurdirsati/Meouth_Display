# üñ•Ô∏è E-Paper Desk Display with Seeed XIAO RP2040  

Hey BOSS , Look what I've made , another cool project

This is a **cool little desk gadget** I built using a **Seeed XIAO RP2040** and a **4.2‚Ä≥ e-Paper display**.  
It shows the **time, date, temperature, and weather conditions** in real time ‚Äì all information tken from my PC and sent to the e-Paper via USB.  

Think of it as a **minimalist smart desk clock*(  that never distracts, looks awesome, and keeps your workspace futuristic.
