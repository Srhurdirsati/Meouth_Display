**Project Name:** Meouth_Display
**Author:** Rudra Mishra  
**Total Time Spent:** ~14 hours  
**Duration:** 3rd September 2025 â€“ 5th September 2025  

## Description  
This project was built as a personal desk gadget to display time, date, temperature, and weather using a Seeed XIAO RP2040 and a 4.2" e-Paper display.  
The idea was to keep it simple: the XIAO connects to a PC, receives data over USB, and updates the display. I wanted something minimal, functional, and clean for my desk setup.  


### 3rd September 2025: Started the project , plannig completed along with the schematic work [6 Hours]

I thought of begginning with the planning first , i spent my first 4 hours to gather components and make a rough connection diagram in my notebook before in software . I decided to use XIAO RP2040 as this is small and best for this one , enough GPIOs and fast speed . A waveshare 4.2 inch black and white display would be best so I chose that

Then i proceeded to spend my today's last 2 hours on schematic designing online on software and successfully completed it . 


### 4th September 2025: The PCB work with CAD Finsished on same day.  [7.5 Hours]

I just woke up at 7am and got my hands on this one , started designign pcb for the roject I deisigned the schemaitc yesterday . It wasn'tchallenging at all , The pcb needed to be big to support the display from below and the components were also less so it was totally not challenging . Successfully Completed it today .

Now the CAD one , i have a potato PC (i3 2100 and no gpu) so i took FreeCAD as best option but this also took time , anyways , this was a simple project and no such any complex design so finished the Base part first [2 Hours] and then foe the Top part [1.5 Hour]. The Main work for the project was completed now only the Github And JLCPCb part was left 

### 5th September 2025: Finishd the JLCPCB work and GitHub Repo Completed 

Good evening , another day , today was simple , i didn't need to do much work today as only the Github And JLCPCB work was left for this project to be finished . So i did it and now all done . I spent 3.5 Hours on github and rest on JLCPCB
